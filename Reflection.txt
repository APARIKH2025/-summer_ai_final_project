The program worked as intended. It was able to 
execute all the functions necessary to play both 
tic-tac-toe and Connect4. Based on the results, the
choices that we made when creating the program were
appropriate for the task. There is not much that I
would change if I had to code the same thing again.
If we had more time, the only thing that could be
changed would be the heuristic we used. There are no
ethical implications that my program has that others
should be aware of.
