We used the pseudocode to give us a base to work off
of. The overall program was not much different than
that. We tested our system by running and playing
against it ourselves. We would be able to make sure
it was making the correct moves. We also looked for
any errors that came up when trying to run the code.

The program worked as intended. It was able to 
execute all the functions necessary to play both 
tic-tac-toe and Connect4. I would only be able to
look at 5 moves ahead in the connect4 game, but that
is because the heuristic was not very good and the
computer could not handle that many calculations.

Based on the results, the
choices that we made when creating the program were
appropriate for the task. There is not much that I
would change if I had to code the same thing again.
If we had more time, the only thing that could be
changed would be the heuristic we used. There are no
ethical implications that my program has that others
should be aware of.
